# My favorite philosophy books

This is my very first HTML project, I studied some philosophy at the uni, so I tried to create a site that lists my favorite philosophy books. Features include

- DOCTYPE declaration;
- meta charset declaration;
- a Head section;
- use of semantic HTML code;
- links and references;
- images;
- and basic text formatting.

I haven't learned CSS yet, so its not much to look at.

I also wanted to practice markdown and how git commit works, this is why I uploaded this project here.
