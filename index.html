      <img src="kripke.jpg" alt="Cover of Kripke's book" />
      <p>
        <cite>Naming and Necessity</cite> is a 1980 book with the transcript of three lectures, given by the philosopher Saul Kripke, at Princeton University in 1970, in which he dealt with the debates of proper names in the philosophy of language. The transcript was brought out originally in 1972 in <cite>Semantics of Natural Language</cite>, edited by Donald Davidson and Gilbert Harman  Among analytic philosophers, Naming and Necessity is widely considered one of the most important philosophical works of the twentieth century.

      <h3 id="2">2. Ludwig Wittgenstein: Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</h3>
      <img src="wittgenstein.jpg" alt="Cover of Wittgenstein's book" />
      <p>
        The <cite>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</cite> (widely abbreviated and cited as <abbr title="Tractatus">TLP</abbr>) is the only book-length philosophical work by the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein that was published during his lifetime. The project had a broad goal: to identify the relationship between language and reality, and to define the limits of science. Wittgenstein wrote the notes for the Tractatus while he was a soldier during World War I and completed it during a military leave in the summer of 1918. It was originally published in German in 1921 as Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung (Logical-Philosophical Treatise). In 1922 it was published together with an English translation and a Latin title, which was suggested by G. E. Moore as homage to Baruch Spinoza's <cite>Tractatus Theologico-Politicus</cite> (1670).

      <h3 id="3">3. Plato: Meno</h3>
      <img src="plato.jpg" alt="Cover of Plato's book" />
      <p>
        <cite>Meno</cite> (/ˈmiːnoʊ/; Greek: Μένων, Ménōn) is a Socratic dialogue written by Plato. Meno begins the dialogue by asking Socrates whether virtue is taught, acquired by practice, or comes by nature.[1] In order to determine whether virtue is teachable or not, Socrates tells Meno that they first need to determine what virtue is. When the characters speak of virtue, or rather arete, they refer to virtue in general, rather than particular virtues, such as justice or temperance. The first part of the work showcases Socratic dialectical style; Meno, unable to adequately define virtue, is reduced to confusion or aporia. Socrates suggests that they seek an adequate definition for virtue together. In response, Meno suggests that it is impossible to seek what one does not know, because one will be unable to determine whether one has found it.

      <img src="lewis.jpg" alt="Cover of Lewis's book" />
      <p>
        <cite>On the Plurality of Worlds</cite> (1986)[1] is a book by the philosopher David Lewis that defends the thesis of modal realism.[2] <q>The thesis states that the world we are part of is but one of a plurality of worlds,</q> as he writes in the preface, <q>and that we who inhabit this world are only a few out of all the inhabitants of all the worlds.</q> It is not to be confused with cosmic pluralism.

      <h3 id="5">5. Rudolf Carnap: Der Aufbau der Welt</h3>
      <img src="carnap.jpg" alt="Cover of Carnap's book" />
      <p>
        From 1922 to 1925, Carnap worked on a book which became one of his major works, namely <cite>Der logische Aufbau der Welt</cite> (translated as The Logical Structure of the World, 1967), which was accepted in 1926 as his habilitation thesis at the University of Vienna and published as a book in 1928. That achievement has become a landmark in modern epistemology and can be read as a forceful statement of the philosophical thesis of logical positivism. Indeed, the Aufbau suggests that epistemology, based on modern symbolic logic, is concerned with the logical analysis of scientific propositions, while science itself, based on experience, is the only source of knowledge of the external world, i.e. the world outside the realm of human perception. According to Carnap, philosophical propositions are statements about the language of science; they aren't true or false, but merely consist of definitions and conventions about the use of certain concepts. In contrast, scientific propositions are factual statements about the external reality. They are meaningful because they are based on the perceptions of the senses. In other words, the truth or falsity of those propositions can be verified by testing their content with further observations.

      <h3 id="6">6. John Searle: Making the Social World</h3>
      <img src="searle.jpg" alt="Cover of Searle's book" />
      <p>
        In <cite>The Construction of Social Reality</cite> (1995), Searle addresses the mystery of how social constructs like "baseball" or "money" can exist in a world consisting only of physical particles in fields of force. Adapting an idea by Elizabeth Anscombe in "On Brute Facts", Searle distinguishes between brute facts, like the height of a mountain, and institutional facts, like the score of a baseball game. Aiming at an explanation of social phenomena in terms of Anscombe's notion, he argues that society can be explained in terms of institutional facts, and institutional facts arise out of collective intentionality through constitutive rules with the logical form <q>X counts as Y in C</q>. Thus, for instance, filling out a ballot counts as a vote in a polling place, getting so many votes counts as a victory in an election, getting a victory counts as being elected president in the presidential race.

      <h3 id="7">7. Saul Kripke: Reference and Existence</h3>
      <img src="kripke2.jpg" alt="Cover of Kripke's second book" />
      <p>
        <cite>Reference and Existence</cite>, Saul Kripke's John Locke Lectures for 1973, can be read as a sequel to his classic <cite>Naming and Necessity</cite>. It confronts important issues left open in that work -- among them, the semantics of proper names and natural kind terms as they occur in fiction and in myth; negative existential statements; the ontology of fiction and myth (whether it is true that fictional characters like Hamlet, or mythical kinds like bandersnatches, might have existed). In treating these questions, he makes a number of methodological observations that go beyond the framework of his earlier book -- including the striking claim that fiction cannot provide a test for theories of reference and naming. In addition, these lectures provide a glimpse into the transition to the pragmatics of singular reference that dominated his influential paper, "Speaker's Reference and Semantic Reference" -- a paper that helped reorient linguistic and philosophical semantics. Some of the themes have been worked out in later writings by other philosophers -- many influenced by typescripts of the lectures in circulation -- but none have approached the careful, systematic treatment provided here. The virtuosity of Naming and Necessity -- the colloquial ease of the tone, the dazzling, on-the-spot formulations, the logical structure of the overall view gradually emerging over the course of the lectures -- is on display here as well.

      <h3 id="8">8. Amie L. Thomasson: Fiction and Metaphysics</h3>
      <img src="thomasson.jpg" alt="Cover of Thomasson's book" />
      <p>
        This challenging study places fiction squarely at the center of the discussion of metaphysics. Philosophers have traditionally treated fiction as involving a set of narrow problems in logic or the philosophy of language. By contrast Amie Thomasson argues that fiction has far-reaching implications for central problems of metaphysics. The book develops an "artifactual" theory of fiction, whereby fictional characters are abstract artifacts as ordinary as laws or symphonies or works of literature. In taking seriously the work of literary scholars and in citing a wide range of literary examples, this book will interest not only philosophers concerned with metaphysics and the philosophy of language, but also those in literary theory interested in these foundational issues.

        This entirely new translation of <cite>Critique of Pure Reason</cite> is the most accurate and informative English translation ever produced of this epochal philosophical text. Though its simple, direct style will make it suitable for all new readers of Kant, the translation displays a philosophical and textual sophistication that will enlighten Kant scholars as well. This translation recreates as far as possible a text with the same interpretative nuances and richness as the original.

        A <cite>Critical Introduction to Fictionalism</cite> provides a clear and comprehensive understanding of an important alternative to realism. Drawing on questions from ethics, the philosophy of religion, art, mathematics, logic and science, this is a complete exploration of how fictionalism contrasts with other non-realist doctrines and motivates influential fictionalist treatments across a range of philosophical issues.
